The intranet site will be placed on the \nhome.enron.com webpage by Tuesday morning for all Enron employees to access. \nHowever, today, this comprehensive database is available to you for your \nCalifornia Power Issue needs. \n\nThe database has been populated with the latest information that I have \nreceived concerning this topic and has been broken down in three categories:\nCalifornia Power Issues, National Power Issues and Secured Documents. It has \nthen been broken down further into subcategories.\n\nThe secured documents sections will only be accessible to those that are \nreceiving this e-mail. Please let me know if you believe others should have \naccess to this information. The secured document section contains all the \ninformation that I have received that Luntz Consulting has helped us develop, \ni.e. principals, statements, speeches and facts, as well as, talking points \nand other statements developed internally. These documents can be easily \nswitched to open access to all Enron employees if you believe that these \ndocuments should not be restricted.\n\nTo access the intranet site you must be logged on to the network and then go \nto this link:  http://nahou-lndev02d.corp.enron.com/GovtAffa.nsf  (It is best \nif you copy this link and paste it in your internet Explorer or Netscape \nbrowser.)\n\nOnce you are at this site you will  be able to access all articles and \ninformation that I have collected/received concerning the California Power \nIssue. You can navigate the site by using the links on the left hand side of \nthe screen. While navigating this site, keep in mind that the actual \ninterface will be changed before we go live on Tuesday morning. \n\nTo access the secured documents, click on secured documents and type in your \nuser name, which is the same as if you are logging onto the network, and then \ntype in your password, which is the same as if you are logging onto the \nnetwork. However, if you have difficulties entering this site, you will need \nto change your Lotus internet password. Which is very simple to do and which \nyou will need to do regardless if you decide to use this site or not, it is \nall part of the current computer migration. To change your internet password, \ngo to this link  and then hit the edit person key. Go to the last field that \nsays internet password and type in whatever password you would like, \npreferably your current network login password. (In the internet password \nsection you will see a bunch of numbers and letters, delete those and enter \nyour new network password.) \n\nThere are still some bugs that will be worked out by Tuesday, but I thought \nsince this is such a fast moving issue it was best to get this tool out so it \ncould be used when needed.

(Dutch, English, first price-sealed bid, \nand second-price sealed bid.) In fact, the selling price is equal to the \nvaluation of the second highest bidder. For example, in Vickrey auction, \neveryone bids at his own valuation. Hence, the winner pays the valuation of \nthe second highest bidder. In English auction, the second highest valuation \nbidder will stop competing if the price is above his valuation. Hence, the \nwinner also gets the item at the price of the second highest valuation bidder.\nThank you for attending the meeting and giving many helpful contributions.\n-chonawee", "meta": {}, "labels": [[0, 9, "salutation"], [11, 300, "paragraph"], [302, 508, "paragraph"], [510, 555, "paragraph"], [557, 562, "closing"], [594, 613, "quotation_marker"], [614, 652, "inline_headers"], [670, 1429, "paragraph"], [1430, 1439, "closing"], [653, 668, "inline_headers"], [569, 593, "quotation_marker"]]}

The program gives prospective parents an \nopportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of \nadopting an older  child.\n \nIn 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - \n96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 \npercent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through \nthe program.

I need your \nhelp to make sure I have \"Gore-like\" command of the details.  Please help \nwith the following information:\nEnron project information (Parquet/McCubbin) -- please give me any \npresentations or summaries you have on the generation, or firm purchases, we \nhave under way (or planned).  I'll talk with you to find out what we are \ncomfortable disclosing but please err on the side of giving whatever \ninformation you have.\nUpdated Belden presentation (Hain/Belden) -- I believe the latest information \nwas as of August; I think some of the information on the cost of peaking \nfacilities is particularly eye-opening on the price cap issue.\nComparison to PJM (Hartsoe/Novosel) -- Is the information we are seeking from \nthe ISO and PX similar to information PJM already provides?  If so, it would \nbe nice to tie our requests back to something the Commission has already \napproved.\nCancelled DSM projects (Mahoney) -- Again, I'll only use what we feel \ncomfortable with, but it would help make our point if we can give examples of \nhow price caps backfire when it comes to encouraging conservation.\nISO/PX reports (Dasovich).  I have the ISO market surveillance report.  Is \nthere another ISO report?  If so, please get me a copy and provide a copy of \nthe PX report too.\nCEC/Proposed generation update (Mara/Parquet) -- Need the basic information: \nproposed, waiting for permitting; how much/little the legislation did to \nexpedite siting (ie are we still comfortable saying that it applies to less \nthan 10%)?\nSoft cap(Belden/Hain) -- need a crisp explanation of why the \"soft\" nature of \nthe cap is not sufficient.  Also, would we be OK if the Commission revised it \nto say that bids can be taken above 150 without special filing or reporting \nrequirements, but those bids will be accepted at the price bid rather than \napplying to all lower bids as well (ie the highest bid at or below 150 clears \nthe market, bids above 150 accepted at price bid as needed)?\nOffers we have made/deals done (Parquet/Dasovich/ Mccubbin) -- Roseville plus \nany others, offer made to SDG&E -- I want to make the point that the market \nwill provide solutions (below the retail price cap) if we get the utility \n(and the regulators) out of the merchant function.\nHerding the cats(Hartsoe/mccubbin/mara/dasovich):  We are asking FERC to be \ncourageous, do the right thing and ignore the politics.  To be even halfway \ncredible, we can't have IEP, EPSA, Dynegy or anyone else \"squishing\" on the \nprice cap issue..

To increase our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid Stentofon address numbers.  Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 and 900 series numbers for the addresses.  In order to add more addresses to the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system.  This conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th.\n\nIn efforts to minimize the number of times each user will change their number, we will be converting all Stentofon addresses in EB1 that are scheduled to move into ESC this year to a 5000 series number.    (i.e.  If your Stento number was 364, then your new number will be 5364.)  We will also change all speed dials to reflect the new dialing scheme.  Please instruct the users within your group of this change.\n\nAll Enron Broadband Stentofons will have their numbers changed to a 4000 series number.  (i.e.  If your Stento number was 576, then your new number will be 4576.)  \n\nIn summary, all Stentofon numbers will be changing this weekend.  If you are scheduled to move into ECS, then your Stento number will begin with a '5' and if you are to remain at EB1, then your Stento number will begin with a '4'.\n\nPlease inform all users of the Stentofon System of this change and pass this information to anyone that needs it.\n\n\nThank you for your understanding and cooperation.\n\nRegards, \nDarren Adamik\nMgr.-Trading Technology \nEnron Net Works, LLC \n713.853.4764 Office\n713-853-9828 Fax\nmailto:darren.p.adamik@enron.com", "meta": {}, "labels": [[0, 26, "quotation_marker"], [27, 944, "inline_headers"], [1035, 1630, "paragraph"], [1632, 2044, "paragraph"], [2046, 2210, "paragraph"], [2212, 2442, "paragraph"], [2444, 2557, "paragraph"], [2560, 2609, "paragraph"], [2611, 2620, "closing"], [2621, 2751, "personal_signature"], [945, 961, "inline_headers"], [963, 1032, "section_heading"]]}

The only concern I have is the reference\nat the end of the first paragraph to  \"the crisis grows daily with no clear\nresolution offering long term relief in sight.\"  In fact we do no have\nseveral bills on demand side management, one by Wright on accelerating\nrepowering of power plants and allowing incentives for voluntary\nconservation, at least a vehicle for utility cost recovery (AB-18X), and a\nBown bill to restore direct access rights compromised by AB-1X.  So I am\nconcerned that the legislative leadership would take some umbrage at the\nnotion that we dont see any of what they are doing as offering hope for a\nlong term solution.  Perhaps we could rephrase it to say that the piecemeal\nelements of positive solutions that have been discussed or offered need to\nbe clarified and blended into a comprehensive proposal which has the\nfollowing elements....and then lay out our case.\n\nSandi, do you agree with my concerns?  Otherwise the elements of the letter\nare fine, and track what we are trying to draft in terms of legislative\nlanguage.

{"id": 143151, "text": "Borderline\nNo.  2001-22\nOctober 30, 2001<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" />\n\n \n\nNovember 1 Tariff Change\n\nTariff revisions detailing and addressing the use of an Operational Flow Order (OFO) on Northern Border, which were part of Northern Border's approved Park and Loan (PAL) filing, will become effective on November 1.   Here is a brief overview of the upcoming changes.\n\n \nPurpose of an OFO\n \nAn OFO will be used by Northern Border to 1) alleviate conditions that threaten the integrity of the system, 2) maintain pipeline operations at pressures required to provide efficient and reliable transportation service, 3) assure adequate system line pack, and 4) maintain service for all of Northern Border's firm shippers.   \n \nAn OFO will be treated as a tool of last resort.  Northern Border will first attempt to utilize its system, its services (transportation and PAL), and if necessary, assistance of interconnecting systems to alleviate operational problems before invoking its OFO tariff provisions.\n \n \nPosting of an OFO Watch\n \nIf resolution of an operational problem is unlikely, such as when a daily or cumulative OBA imbalance with an interconnected party is outside of a defined tolerance range, Northern Border will post an OFO watch.  Similar to a severe weather notice, the purpose of an OFO watch is to pre-alert shippers and interconnecting systems to a location or area on Northern Border's system in which underlying operational conditions could prompt the issuance of an OFO.\n \n\n\nOFO Issuance\n \nNorthern Border will issue an OFO if it is determined that an OFO watch has failed to serve as a catalyst for corrective action. \n \nA Northern Border OFO will be as localized as is reasonably possible.  Furthermore, each OFO will be tailored to match the severity of the known or anticipated problem being addressed.\n \n \nOFO Impact\n \nAn OFO can result in either the curtailment of interruptible services and/or the forced balancing of nominations and actual flows through the confirmation process.   \n \nIf service is reduced or interrupted due to an OFO, Northern Border will directly provide affected shippers, as soon as possible, a summary of the service interruption that will include the operational variables that prompted such action.  In addition, affected shippers will be notified of any imbalances that require immediate resolution.\n \nRoutine status updates will be posted throughout the period in which the OFO is in effect.\n \n \nFailure to Comply\n \nWhen an OFO is issued, it is the responsibility of the affected shippers to make a good faith effort to comply.  If such shippers fail to respond to the OFO, or their response is insufficient to correct the problem, Northern Border may take further action including the curtailment of firm service or the immediate cash out of cumulative imbalances that are in excess of 10% of the Historical Flow Quantity.\n \nNorthern Border will not be liable for any costs incurred by a shipper in complying with or be exposed to any damages that result from an interruption in service due to an OFO.\n \n \nImpact of OFO Tariff Changes on Interconnects\n \nFERC Order No. 637 requires that pipelines \"take all reasonable actions to minimize the issuance and adverse impact of Operational Flow Orders (OFOs).\"  Northern Border recognizes that maintaining daily and cumulative OBA imbalances with its interconnected parties within reasonable tolerances levels is critical in meeting such obligation across the grid.  Consequently, the November 1 tariff changes includes language which define what is an acceptable tolerance range on a Northern Border OBA imbalance.\n \nTo serve as a benchmark, Northern Border has already begun calculating a Historical Flow Quantity (HFQ) for each point of interconnection on Northern Border's system.  The HFQ is the lesser of the average daily scheduled quantity for the previous 15 consecutive Gas Days or the actual daily flow quantity for such time period.   \n \nOn November 1, the default cumulative OBA imbalance tolerance level for a given interconnect on Northern Border's system will be +/- 10% of the point's HFQ.   If such approach fails to meet the needs of an interconnected party, Northern Border's tariff does permit the use of an alternative tolerance level at a given point of interconnect as long as it has been mutually agreed to both OBA parties.\n \nFurthermore, the daily OBA swings at interconnects on Northern Border that are on pressure control will also be monitored more closely; the default daily OBA imbalance tolerance level will be +/- 5% of the daily scheduled quantity.  Once again, Northern Border's tariff does permit deviation from this \"standardized\" daily tolerance if an alternative method is mutually acceptable to the OBA parties. \n \nFor those who would like to initiate discussions on establishing OBA imbalance tolerance levels with Northern Border that deviate from the defaults described above, please contact Scott Coburn at (402) 398.7760.", "meta": {}, "labels": [[0, 116, "paragraph"], [147, 414, "paragraph"], [438, 766, "paragraph"], [769, 1048, "paragraph"], [1079, 1538, "paragraph"], [1543, 1555, "section_heading"], [1558, 1687, "paragraph"], [1690, 1874, "paragraph"], [1879, 1889, "section_heading"], [1892, 2058, "paragraph"], [2061, 2401, "paragraph"], [2404, 2494, "paragraph"], [2519, 2926, "paragraph"], [2929, 3105, "paragraph"], [3158, 3664, "paragraph"], [3667, 3996, "paragraph"], [3999, 4398, "paragraph"], [4401, 4802, "paragraph"], [4805, 5016, "paragraph"], [1053, 1076, "section_heading"], [418, 435, "section_heading"], [121, 145, "section_heading"], [2499, 2516, "section_heading"], [3110, 3155, "section_heading"]]}

{"id": 143164, "text": "In Mark Baldwin's June 19 letter, he proposed the following fee schedule for \nproject development:\n\nRetainer:  $1000/month plus expenses\nAccepted project (meets TW's predetermined financial hurdles):  Proposal $5000\nEach month TW actively negotiating project:  $1500/month (each project)\nLetter of Intent:  $5000\nSigned Agreement:  $10,000\n Incentive Fee:  To be determined\n\n When I spoke with Mark, he explained that this schedule was based on \nreaching certain milestones in the development of individual projects.  In \nhis letter he also proposed monthly fees for regulatory services ($5000/mo.) \nand market development services (including SoCal OIR related services -- \n$3000/mo.).  This e-mail addresses the project development fee structure \nonly. \n\n The recently expired Market Development agreement with IGS provided for a \none-time retainer of $15,000 and a monthly retainer of $5000, plus expenses, \nand an incentive fee structure for any agreement between Transwestern and \nthird party \"identified by IGS under this agreement.\"  As you know, the \n\"identified by\" language presented us with some ambiguity in the case of the \nSouthern Energy Gallup Expansion contract, in which both IGS and the TW \nCommercial Group worked on the deal.  Fortunately, the ambiguity worked to \nTranswestern's advantage in that case, but my understanding is that in \nongoing dealings with IGS both parties would prefer more specificity in any \nfuture consulting agreement.\n\n Mark's proposal represents a step in the right direction because it provides \nfor payment on a per-project basis.  This immediately eliminates the \n\"identified by\" problem because we won't be obligated to pay him unless and \nuntil he identifies a project we're interested in him working on.\n\n I propose that we define some general terms and conditions in an enabling \nagreement.  If Mark brings us a project we want to pursue, we will pay him \naccording to these terms (and any other terms and conditions tailored to the \nspecific project, as needed).  For each project, we would simply enter into a \nshort letter agreement referencing the enabling agreement.  I've outlined the \nagreement below as a starting point for discussion.  The numbers are Mark's; \nwe'll have to discuss whether they are appropriate.  I've omitted any payment \nfor a letter of intent because since they are nonbinding, letters of intent \nare of little value to Transwestern.\n\n  Call me after you've reviewed this and let's discuss how you want to \nproceed.\n\n\n\nFrom time to time during the term of the enabling agreement, IGS may present \nbrief, preliminary project proposals to Transwestern.  If Transwestern \ndesires IGS's assistance in developing a particular project, it will so \nnotify IGS in writing and shall execute an agreement with IGS adopting the \nfollowing terms and conditions:\n\n1.  Retainer for project development:  $1000/month plus expenses.  Project \ndevelopment shall include but not be limited to:  research, due diligence, \nmarket analysis, negotiation with counterparties (to the extent specifically \nauthorized by Transwestern), reporting to marketing representatives of \nTranswestern as requested by Transwestern, and preparing a detailed written \nproposal.  Transwestern and IGS may agree in writing to other \nproject-specific requirements.  Transwestern shall continue to pay the \nretainer each month until a definitive agreement is signed with the \ncounterparty or Transwestern notifies IGS in writing that it has decided to \nterminate the project.  \n\n2.  If Transwestern accepts the project described in IGS's written proposal \n(or with modifications after reviewing the written proposal), it shall pay \nIGS a fee of [the lesser of] $5000 [or ___% of the net present value of the \nproject].  \"Accepting the project\" means that the project meets \nTranswestern's financial, regulatory and other criteria and the Transwestern \nCommercial Group has obtained the necessary officer approval to pursue the \nproject to completion.  Accepting the project and paying IGS pursuant to this \nparagraph in no way obligates Transwestern to pursue the project to \ncompletion.\n\n3.  If Transwestern signs a definitive agreement with a counterparty for the \nproject, it shall pay IGS $10,000.  Additionally, the parties may negotiate \nan additional incentive fee (to be agreed upon and documented at the outset \nof the project).\n\n(I will also include provisions on termination, confidentiality, etc.).", "meta": {}, "labels": [[0, 98, "paragraph"], [100, 215, "tabular"], [375, 754, "paragraph"], [756, 1462, "paragraph"], [1464, 1755, "paragraph"], [1757, 2415, "paragraph"], [2417, 2497, "paragraph"], [2501, 2831, "paragraph"], [2833, 3517, "paragraph"], [3519, 4127, "paragraph"], [4129, 4377, "paragraph"], [4379, 4450, "paragraph"], [216, 373, "tabular"]]}

Voting 7-0 on its own motion, this very \nactivist court of all Democrats\nordered Secretary of State Harris not to certify the vote \"until further \norder of the court.\" This is a massive\nvictory for Gore (and more than even the Gore forces expected) and completely \nreverses the devastating\nbody blow dealt by Lewis this morning. A hearing is scheduled for Monday at 2 \npm on the issue of the\nmanual recounts.\n\nWhat this means is the counting will go forward on a 24-hour basis in Palm \nBeach and Broward counties.\n This also saps the Bush campaign of much of the positive PR momentum they \nhad built up as we\nhead into the weekend.\n\nThe justices set a hearing time Monday to begin hearing arguments for a final \nruling in the matter, but this\nquick ruling on appeal is extremely favorable to Gore and should allow the \ncounties time to get real votes\ntallied and leaked out to the public. Republican observers in the counties \nhave been doing their job and\nobjecting so strenuously to every possible problem that they have prevented \nPalm Beach from finishing even\none precinct over the past two days. That has kept any numbers from leaking \nto the public as of this writing.\nBut now the Democrats have until at least Monday to get some numbers out in \npublic.\n\nThe slow pace of the recount augurs poorly for a final resolution of the \nelection.  Dade County, Florida's most populous has just\nannounced that they will recount over 1 million ballots--which they say could \ntake up to a month.\n\nWe note that the NASDAQ is off 12 percent since election.  Prolonged \nuncertainty is only bad news for the markets, as the world waits \nfor a sense of direction about US leadership on a range of issues from high \noil prices to the Mid-East peace process to \neconomic uncertainties in Argentina and in major currency markets.", "meta": {}, "labels": [[0, 75, "quotation_marker"], [131, 150, "quotation_marker"], [151, 300, "inline_headers"], [1107, 1652, "paragraph"], [1654, 1875, "paragraph"], [1877, 2504, "paragraph"], [2506, 2735, "paragraph"], [2737, 3061, "paragraph"], [301, 1105, "inline_headers"], [115, 130, "quotation_marker"], [76, 112, "quotation_marker"]]}

Robert Collins, Jr., President\n\nRE:\t\tEXCHANGE TO LOWER COST OF EXCHANGE OF FUTURES FOR SWAP\nTRANSACTIONS\n\nThe New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., today announced that it would lower\nthe cost of exchange of futures for swap (EFS) transactions to $2.50 per\ncontract per side from $10 per contract per side and would apply the\ndiscounted fee retroactively to the natural gas transactions conducted since\nthe start of the program yesterday.\n\nWe are gratified that the strong response to the introduction of this\ntrading instrument will allow us to so heavily discount the transaction fee.\n\nThe Exchange introduced EFS transactions in its natural gas futures market\nyesterday as the first step of its plans to offer clearing services to the\nover-the-counter (OTC) natural gas market.  In its first full day, there\nwere 11,100 contracts that changed hands in EFS transactions.\n\nEFS transactions work similarly to exchange of futures for physical (EFP)\ntransactions.  Two parties are allowed to privately negotiate the execution\nof an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures transaction on\npricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The transaction must\ninvolve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market quantities of\nfutures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities and are\npermitted until two hours after trading terminates in the underlying futures\ncontract.\n\nEFS transactions are permitted to liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures\nmarket positions between the two parties involved in the transaction.  The\nclearing member representing each party is responsible to notify the\nExchange of the amount of futures contracts involved, the price at which the\nfutures transaction should be cleared, and the identity of the parties\ninvolved.\n\nYear-to-date average daily volume in natural gas futures is approximately\n60,000 contracts.

The pending joint survey.\n\n (a) The joint survey has yet to be scheduled.  The reason for the delay is \nan issue concerning whether SGS's Singapore laboratory has the \nresources/competence to carry out the joint analysis.  Steve Jones, ECT's \nchoice of chemist, is communicating with SGS in order to make this \ndetermination.  Although this has delayed scheduling the joint testing, Jones \nfeels strongly that it will be most cost-effective for ECT to proceed with a \njoint analysis only after making this determination.  I (and Matt) have \npersonally spoken with Jones about this and believe he understands that ECT \nis looking for the quickest, most cost-effective resolution to this dispute \nwith Mitsubishi.  Because of the issue with SGS, Jones has waited until now \nto send the proposed testing program to Technichem, Mitsubishi's choice of \nsurveyor/chemist  (in a previous report, I mentioned that the testing program \nhad already been sent to Technichem; this now turns out not to be the case).  \nBy today, Jones should have sent the proposed testing program to Technichem, \nin order to get the ball rolling, and with the expectation that Technichem \nwill have comments that will require time to incorporate.  \n\n (b) If things go well with SGS, Jones anticipates scheduling a joint \nanalysis about two-three weeks from now.  Jones plan to personally attend the \njoint survey on our behalf, given the complexity of the testing methods.  \nEven after that testing, Jones anticipates the possibility of further testing \nin England using highly specialized equipment to determine whether the \napparent filterable dirt buildup was caused by a malfunction of the vessel's \ninert gas system.\n\n2. Costs.  \n\n (a)  Surveyors/chemists:\n\n (1) Jones advises that to date, he and his firm have spent a total of about \n5.5 days at 720 pounds per day, for a total of approximately 3,960 pounds, or \nroughly $5,742 at the current USD/pounds exchange rate of $1.45/1 pound.  \nJones has subcontracted some of his work to Allen Goddard, now with ITS-Caleb \nBrett, who specializes in the type of testing at issue.  Jones estimates that \nGoddard has spent approximately one day on this matter, at a daily rate of \n600 lbs, or $870.\n \n (2)  Jones estimates that from this point until the actual joint survey \nbegins, he will spend about two more days, and Goddard will spend about \nanother one-half day.  This totals about 1,740 pounds, or $2,523.\n\n (3)   For the actual joint testing, Jones estimates that he will spend about \ntwelve days straight, including transit time; Goddard would not attend, but \nwould be available by telephone if Jones had a question.  Twelve days' time \namounts to 8,640 pounds, or $12,528, not including aire fare, room and board.\n\n (4)  Afterwards, for the additional testing in England to determine whether \nthe inert gas system caused the buildup in filterable dirt, Jones estimates \nanother 2,000 pounds for the cost of the lab; he does not know at this point \nwhether he would attend the entire testing procedure, which he believes could \nbe \ncompleted in about two days.  If he attended both days, this additional \ntesting in England would run to another 3,440 pounds, or $4,988.\n\n (b) Other experts:\n \n (1) SGS and Caleb Brett's costs to date are being compiled by Matt.  SGS \nwill spend another SGD 2,000 purchasing the necessary chemicals for the joint \ntesting, and bill for another SGD 2,000 for pre-joint-analysis development \nwork (basically, practicing on extra samples from the PACIFIC VIRGO).  This \ncomes to a total of SGD 4,000, or  about $2,325 to prepare for the joint \nanalysis, based on the current reported SGD/USD exchange rate of 1.72/1.  SGS \nestimates that it will bill us for the joint analysis SGD 9,500, or about \n$5,523.\n\n (2) Captain Sawant of PacMarine, one of our ship operations experts, will be \ncharging us SGD 25,000, or about $14,500  for work done to date, which should \nbe largely concluded with the finalization of his report.  \n\n (3)  Captain Gregory of Noble Denton, the ship operation expert we would \nprobably use for testifying, has been asked to do no work on this matter at \nthis time. \n\n (c) Attorneys:\n\n (1) David Best is out of town on vacation, but his office advises that his \ntime and expenses to date amounts to approximately 8,300 pounds, or about \n$12,035.  This is subject to being adjusted up or down, once Best gets back \nin the office and has time to review the bill.  I imagine that this bill does \nnot include the time incurred by a barrister that Best called for advice on \nthe FGH issue.  Neither Best nor anyone from his firm will need to attend the \njoint testing.\n\n (2) Neale Gregson's firm, Watson, Farley, has incurred fees and expense to \ndate of SGD 105,000, or about $61,000.  Matt has not yet seen an itemized \nbill for this time, but feels that while it is high, it is not unexpected, \ngiven the time-intensive nature of this matter.  Matt will be asking Gregson \nwhether the time also includes time spent on the FGH matter.\n \n (3) My and my legal assistant's fee and expenses through today amount to \napproximately $12,500.  This also includes time spent on the FGH matter, \nalthough, pursuant to Alan's instructions, I am no longer spending time on \nthat matter, except where necessary to keep Janice Moore apprised. \n\n (d) Summary of Costs.\n\n In sum, no less than approximately $106,000 has been spent to date, and this \nfigure will increase once I get the SGS and Caleb Brett costs to date, and \nonce David Best comes back from vacation on September 11 and reviews his bill \n(although these figures probably include a heavy overlap of time spent on the \nFGH matter).  Another $5,325 will be necessary to get ready for the joint \nanalysis; another $18,000 to perform the joint analysis in Singapore, and \nanother approximately $5,000 to perform specialized testing in London after \nthe joint analysis is done (if Steve Jones determines that such further \ntesting is necessary).\n\n3.  Recent Sale of Thailand cargo.  \n\n (a) You will recall that the bulk of the product from the M/V PACIFIC VIRGO \nwas discharged in to shore tanks in Thailand and has not been tendered to \nFGH, given the problems with the product discharged later in the Phillipines, \nwhich was tendered to FGH, who rejected it.  Samples from the shore tanks in \nThailand have recently been tested by SGS's laboratory in the U.S. and \nreportedly found on spec.  All of the Thailand product has recently been sold \nto Caltex, Singapore, for delivery September 7-9, reportedly for use in \nCaltex's refinery, which makes the risk of rejection of that product by \nCaltex very low.  \n\n (b) Unfortunately, Matt advises that the trader cannot give us even a \nballpark figure for the sales price of the Thailand product until the end of \nthe month, given that the price is tied to some market index.  Lacking this, \nit is difficult to estimate what total diminution in market value of the \nElang crude ECT has sustained until then.  We were previously told that the \nproduct discharged in Singapore sustained a diminution in market value of \nabout $288,000.  For my own purposes, based on nothing more than speculation, \nand given that the bulk of the cargo was discharged in Thailand, I am using \nthe working hypothesis that ECT's total damages for diminution of market \nvalue of all the product discharged from the M/V PACIFIC VIRGO is in the \nrange of $600,000-$750,000.  Again, this may later turn out to be very \ninaccurate.       \n\n4.  Expert witness supplemental opinion\n\n  At my request, Captain Sawant, our consulting expert on ship operations, \nwas asked whether he believed that ECT's instructions to the ship regarding \ntank washing would have been sufficient to prevent the type of contamination \nthat occurred had such instructions been properly carried out (i.e., if the \nship had access to fresh water).  Captain Sawant has opined that he does not \nbelieve such instructions were sufficient to have prevented the type of \ncontamination that occurred.   While we can protect Captain Sawant's opinion \nfrom discovery by using him only as a consulting expert, it strikes me that \nMitsubishi will likely not overlook this issue.  Despite this, however, ECT \nstill has some argument that the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act puts a \nnon-delegable duty to provide a cargoworthy ship on Mitsubishi.", "meta": {}, "labels": [[0, 5, "salutation"], [7, 79, "paragraph"], [83, 95, "closing"], [114, 133, "quotation_marker"], [134, 238, "inline_headers"], [441, 479, "inline_headers"], [481, 486, "closing"], [488, 566, "paragraph"], [568, 948, "paragraph"], [950, 1035, "paragraph"], [1037, 1049, "closing"], [1054, 1233, "inline_headers"], [1469, 1568, "paragraph"], [1601, 2793, "paragraph"], [2795, 3266, "paragraph"], [3281, 3306, "paragraph"], [3308, 3791, "paragraph"], [3794, 4006, "paragraph"], [4008, 4318, "paragraph"], [4320, 4773, "paragraph"], [4797, 5339, "paragraph"], [5341, 5558, "paragraph"], [5560, 5723, "paragraph"], [5742, 6220, "paragraph"], [6222, 6588, "paragraph"], [6591, 6883, "paragraph"], [6909, 7544, "paragraph"], [7584, 8209, "paragraph"], [8211, 9059, "paragraph"], [9102, 9926, "paragraph"], [239, 438, "inline_headers"], [1234, 1347, "inline_headers"], [1350, 1382, "inline_headers"], [3268, 3277, "section_heading"], [4775, 4794, "section_heading"], [1570, 1599, "section_heading"], [1384, 1467, "section_heading"], [5725, 5740, "section_heading"], [6885, 6907, "section_heading"], [7546, 7580, "section_heading"], [9061, 9100, "section_heading"], [101, 113, "quotation_marker"]]}

We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the \"Gridiron Guru.\"   \t[IMAGE]\tInside      ? Plan for the Playoffs   ? Game-by-Game Analysis   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   \t\n\n\n [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  \t\n\n\n    Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.  \t\n\n\n    Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production.  \t\n\n\n    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   \t\n\n\n  Question - Mike Blake     I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten?    Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad.  \t\n\n\n  Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    Answer - GG     Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.   \t\n\n\n  Question - Chris Gilcrest     Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?     Answer - GG     Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore.   \t\n\n\n    Tip of the Week      Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay  healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his  solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to  another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best  Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an  unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.    \t\n\n\n  This message has been sent to dutch.quigley@enron.com, provided free of charge and free of obligation.

But before the governor \nand the Public Utilities Commission cut yet another deal costing consumers \nbillions of dollars, perhaps they should pause to ask the public what kind of \nsystem it wants and what it will end up with after investing billions more. \nFailure of energy deregulation could speed real deregulation that might \nbenefit consumers with real capacity and real competition. But this will not \nhappen if the focus is only on California utilities and their shareholders. \nThe original deregulation deal was designed, as I see it, to keep competition \nout of California -- and to maximize the rates consumers would pay for every \nbad past business decision by PG&E and other California utilities. \nSimilarly, current bailout discussions are about forcing California \nratepayers to pay for the failed deregulation plan designed by the utilities \nthemselves. Once again, the companies seek to maximize profits and socialize \nthe losses. \nFollowing on the heels of California's deregulation, the state's utilities \ncame to the congressional delegation and urged us to protect the plan from \nfederal deregulation efforts. They argued that the deal they cut was good for \nall parties. Their executives repeated time and again that they might benefit \nfrom the plan's cap on consumer prices -- and that there was a risk to them \nif wholesale prices were to go up. \nThis, they told us, is the marketplace. They were willing to absorb the risk. \nThis was the brave new world of free markets. \nBut markets are never free. From the beginning, this deregulation plan was \ndesigned to buy the California utilities time and advantage. Initially, \nconsumers saw lower rates, but not as low as real competition might have \nprovided when compared to the heavily sheltered market of the past five \nyears. Now, because this rigged marketplace has failed, the utilities want \nagain to put their hands into the ratepayers' pockets. \nAt first, PG&E and Southern California Edison asked the Public Utilities \nCommission to have California consumers pay the entire cost of deregulation's \nrisks. Their idea did not pass the smell or the laugh test. \nNow the utilities look for a way to repackage their old proposal, including a \nsubstantial rate increase. The rationale is that the utilities may collapse \nfinancially. This threat is supposed to inspire Gov. Gray Davis and the PUC \nto quickly put the ratepayer on the hook for the utilities' failures. \nDuring the past year, dozens of utilities have merged all across America. \nPG&E, for example, may not be worth much to its shareholders, but like AT&T, \nit may be worth something to its competitors. This is the genius of the \nAmerican marketplace. \nPG&E shareholders bought the stock, assuming the risk. Why should the \nratepayers be asked to insulate them from that risk? During this past year, \ntens of billions of dollars of market capitalization were lost by various \nSilicon Valley high-tech firms. Their shareholders do not get the benefit of \ngoing to the PUC and getting a taxpayer bailout. \nThe ratepayer has already paid for this energy under a contract that \nutilities struck with the people of the state of California. Any additional \npayment by the ratepayer is a financial bailout. Any prudent investor would \nask what the return will be before handing over billions of dollars. The \nratepayer deserves an answer, as well as some equity or other consideration. \nGeorge Miller is a Democratic congressman from Martinez.", "meta": {}, "labels": [[0, 45, "paragraph"], [87, 3743, "paragraph"], [46, 85, "paragraph"]]}

{"id": 143223, "text": "1. Alberta PPA - Transmission Cost Responsibility Hearing \n\nEnron is leading a coalition of 5 PPA Buyers that successfully advocated the AEUB to convene a process/hearing (the convening of which was opposed by the PPA Owners) to consider the proposal by the Transmission Administrator to apply transmission charges to PPA Buyers for transmission capacity that solely accrues to the financial benefit of PPA Owners.  One week of hearings were held in spring 2001 with the hearing scheduled to be completed in November 2001.  Value to Enron Canada if we prevail at hearing is approximately $Cdn 60 million.\n\n2. Alberta PPA - Alberta Government Agreement to Split Enron's Sundance B PPA in Two PPAs\n\nGovernment Affairs successfully lobbied Alberta Energy officials and Minister of Energy to agree to approve regulatory changes necessary to allow for the split of Enron's PPA into two PPAs despite one of the fundamental elements of the original PPA model was that the PPAs would be very large and not divisible.  This is important as the whole PPA represents 706 MW and is likely too large for Enron to sell as a whole but a PPA of 303 MW is much more marketable to potential Enron counter parties.  Value to Enron Canada if one-half PPA is sold is projected to be approximately $Cdn 50 million.\n\n3. Alberta PPA - Opposition to Wabamun Water Treatment Plant Expansion \n\nGovernment Affairs in conjunction with legal group has achieved \"effected person\" status in relation to an application by TransAlta (Enron's PPA Owner counterparty) to undertake an expansion to the Wabamun Water Treatment Plant.  The objective is to position Enron to resist future attempts by TransAlta to pass through the cost of this expansion to Enron.  Value to Enron Canada if we succeed is project to be approximately $Cdn 2 million.\n\n4.

We cannot \nretroactively buy from PG&E.  So we will have to argue that PG&E owes us this \nmoney in the CPUC.\nOur large customers, if not on the hook for the expected ctc that results \nfrom this proposal, could say that they refuse to let us take advantage of \nthe lower costs prices because it comes with a recovery ctc period.

Are they saying that, absent synergies, the \ncombined Time/Warner is worth the enterprise value of Time at 189-212 plus \nthe enterprise value of Warner at $63-71 (again, the analysts valuation)?  \nThat just seems ridiculous, give where they\u0001,re trading.\n\nAnyway, here\u0001,s where my analysis is heading----tell me if I\u0001,m smoking crack.\n\nThe deal isn\u0001,t really $175 per share.  It\u0001,s $175 LESS the taxes that will \nhave to paid (since it\u0001,s a purchase deal) PLUS the value of the tax shield \ncreated by the net increase of $8.9B in new debt that Paramount will take \non.  Does this seem right?  Could folks look at my spreadsheet?  I\u0001,ve got it \nconceptually set up, but I\u0001,m not quite sure how to calculate the taxes paid \nunder the purchase method or the value of the tax shield (assuming that this \nis correct.  If I\u0001,m just completely out of it with this angle, just let me \nknow.  In any case, seems that there\u0001,s some value in the tax-free \n(Time-Warner) versus the taxable (Time-Paramount) deals.  Presumably, we \ncould take the total enterprise value of Time-Warner (nontaxed) and compared \nit to the total enterprise of Paramount-Time (taxed) and compare the two.  I\u0001,\nve got a hunch that the Time-Warner number may win the day, but I haven\u0001,t \ngotten that far in the crunching yet.\n\nIn any case, I\u0001,ll be back around Noon tomorrow and will crank the puppy out.\n\nBest,\nJeff", "meta": {}, "labels": [[10, 211, "paragraph"], [213, 332, "paragraph"], [334, 776, "paragraph"], [778, 856, "paragraph"], [858, 1811, "paragraph"], [1813, 1890, "paragraph"], [1892, 1902, "closing"], [0, 8, "salutation"]]}

I recently changed the standard ECB slate of directors of the Caycos \ndirectly owned by Enron Caribbean Basin LLC, to reflect the standard ESA \nslate of directors.  These Caycos all relate to projects or assets in \nColombia and Venezuela.  \n\n2. Early this week Nancy Muchmore mentioned that the new slate of directors \nwould be put into place: Kishkill, Wiggs, Gonzalez (replacing Bannantine and \nChristodoulou), Derrick and Walls. Today\u0001,s email from David Delainey states \nthat Enron Global Assets \u0001) South America will work in close coordination with \nEnron Americas. However with these recent re-organization announcements, \nwould this new slate that Nancy mentioned, apply to the Enron Global Assets \u0001) \nSouth America group? Perhaps, upper management should consider naming some \nkey individual(s) in the South America Assets group to the slate.  I believe \nthat we should keep it simply with one standard slate in place (in case we \nreorganize again), but adding at least some one from the assets side.  \n\n3. I was about to move the mentioned Caycos directly owned by Enron Caribbean \nBasin LLC under Enron South America LLC when the new re-organization was \nannounced.  I will need a directive from Legal as well as from Tax where to \nmove these entities.  \n\n4. Also, there is a list of Caycos (set up for bid purposes in Colombia and \nVenezuela) that management has reviewed and approved to be dissolved.  I plan \nto provide that list to Tax for their review and approval.  \n\n5. Another point to address is the standard slate of directors/officers of \nthose Delaware entities (that have operations in Latin America) which have \nHaug, Cumberland, Castagnola and Sayre named as Directors/Officers.  A \ndecision has to be made who are going to replace these individuals.  \n\nI await your instructions.\n\nDenise\n_______________________________\nDenise G.

{"id": 143274, "text": "FYI,\n\nMy understanding is we adjusted our prices down to the cap today in an \nabundance of caution.\n\n\n\nFYI\n\nWestern Wholesale Power Trades Fri Above FERC Price Limit    \nUpdated: Friday, June 29, 2001 05:42 PM ET   \n  \n\nNEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The price of power in the western wholesale market on \nFriday topped the limits set by federally ordered price controls, traders \nsaid. \n\nBulk electricity trades as high as $107 a megawatt-hour in the western spot \nmarket were confirmed by one of the buyers. Also, Enron Corp.'s (ENE, news, \nmsgs) Internet-based trading system publicly offered to sell power in Nevada \nat $105/MWh. \n\n\n Stock Insight \n \n Symbol Last Change \n \n \n EIX 11.15 -0.35  \n \n \n ENE 49.10 +0.76  \n \n \n PCG 11.20 -1.00  \n \n \n SRE 27.34 -0.14  \n \n \n \n Index \n \n \n Dow Jones 10502.40 -63.81  \n \n \n NASDAQ 2159.34 +33.88  \n \n \n  \n More Analysis \n*  See Analyst Ratings  \n*  Compare Growth Trends  \n*  Get One-Click Scorecard  \n \n  \n \n   \nThe maximum price allowed under a formula set June 18 by the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission is $91.87/MWh. \n\nAsked about the overshoot, FERC said sellers would have to justify prices \nabove the benchmark. \n\n\"We constantly monitor the markets out there,\" a FERC spokeswoman said. \"If \nthere is anything above the proxy price, they would have to come in and \njustify it.\" \n\nEnron spokeswoman Karen Denne said the company posted the $105/MWh offer on \nits EnronOnline system, but didn't sell any power above the FERC limit. \n\nFERC's complicated price limits for the West set a maximum price based on the \noperating cost of the most expensive generator used to meet demand for \nelectricity during power alerts in California. \n\nSuppliers who claim prices above the limits must explain why to FERC, which \ncan order refunds if it isn't convinced. \n\nSome market participants point to a loophole. The FERC order only applies to \n\"spot\" market transactions, which the commission defines as deals done within \n24 hours of the commencement of deliveries. But power traded Friday is for \ndelivery Monday, so some market participants have said that the controls \ndon't apply to Friday deals. \n\n\"It does appear to be a loophole,\" Denne said. \n\nGary Ackerman, executve director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an \nindustry association, said that traders could start doing more transactions \ntwo days in advance to circumvent the FERC rules if market prices rise above \nthe cap, which can change based on prices for natural gas. Or deals could be \ndone at the cap with the seller adding non-monetary payments such as natural \ngas or free electricity delivered later in the year. \n\nOther market participants said they simply will buy needed power supplies at \nthe market price, regardless of the FERC rules. \n\nOn June 19, the first day the new rules took effect, hour-ahead deals were \ndone at $300/MWh. So long as two companies agree to a price and the buyer \ndoesn't later complain to the FERC, it seems that FERC would be hard-pressed \nto enforce its rules. \n\nIf a buyer were to file a complaint after such a deal, it would quickly find \nitself locked out of the market when supplies become tight, traders said. \n\nThe FERC spokeswoman said the above-limit prices would have to be justified \neven without a complaint. \n\nThe price cap will be recalculated whenever the California Independent System \nOperator enters its next Stage 1 supply emergency. At that time the cap will \nlikely be much lower, because gas prices have fallen significantly since the \ncurrent cap was set. \n\n-By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com \n\n(Andrew Dowell contributed to this article.)", "meta": {}, "labels": [[0, 4, "paragraph"], [6, 99, "paragraph"], [103, 106, "paragraph"], [108, 169, "paragraph"], [220, 378, "paragraph"], [380, 625, "paragraph"], [646, 666, "paragraph"], [671, 689, "paragraph"], [717, 735, "paragraph"], [740, 758, "paragraph"], [950, 1064, "paragraph"], [1066, 1162, "paragraph"], [1164, 1327, "paragraph"], [1329, 1478, "paragraph"], [1480, 1678, "paragraph"], [1680, 1798, "paragraph"], [1800, 2136, "paragraph"], [2138, 2185, "paragraph"], [2187, 2624, "paragraph"], [2626, 2752, "paragraph"], [2754, 3005, "paragraph"], [3007, 3159, "paragraph"], [3161, 3264, "paragraph"], [3266, 3522, "paragraph"], [3603, 3647, "paragraph"], [170, 212, "paragraph"], [694, 710, "paragraph"], [777, 936, "paragraph"], [3524, 3600, "personal_signature"], [628, 642, "section_heading"], [765, 771, "section_heading"]]}

Same body size, Same EXACT antler formation (9\" g-2's, with a 2 inch kicker coming out sideways from his left G-2, and crab claw) The only difference b/w these 2 deer was the young one had about 2 inches more spread, and about 15 inches more total antlers) Mass was more on my deer, indicating age. The BIG difference was standing side by side, the younger one looked like a \"thoroughbread Horse\", while mine looked like a mule...if you can understand that. That being said, if we think that we are underestimating age on the hoof and putting all the criteria together about what \"formula\" makes a old deer look old, I would have to say that My 10 point was \"Mature and on his way down\" while the young one (Same deer that Keith has seen, too) is \"Mature and on his way up\". The last thing I have to say about that was that the \"Young\" deer of the two was definitely the \"dominant\" of the two as well. He was aggressive towards my \"ol' bastard\" and the old guy didn't want any part of him...The young one was passed on harvesting by both Keith and myself and I chose to harvest the older one of the two.

This amendment would have \nstricken language that provided an exclusion from CFTC jurisdiction for all \nnon-agriculture transactions (energy, metals, broadband).  The amendment \nfailed, largely due to pressure from Enron, by a vote of 20-12.  Rep. Ken \nBensten (D-TX) joined Chairman Leach in speaking against the amendment.  \n\nIn more positive movement, yesterday the House Commerce Committee passed its \nversion on the bill including a provision that exempts metal trading \nmultilateral trading facilities from CFTC jurisdiction.\n\nCongress goes into recess tomorrow and we will have a better sense on how the \nRules Committee plans to reconcile differences between the versions of the \nbill later this week.

He \nwill miss the game with his team's blessing -- and won't be docked any of his \n$19.286 million season salary.  His absence shouldn't hurt you in a Fantasy \nleague that goess by averages but it could be a problem in leagues that go by \ntotal points.     \n\n Avery Johnson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 \n Johnson is suffering from a bruised left thigh and is questionable for \nMonday's showdown at Utah.  Antonio Daniels will start at point guard if \nJohnson is unable to play.  Even if he does play the bruise may sap him of \nhis speed and hinder his Fantasy production.  Bench Johnson for a while if \npossible.   \n\n Gary Trent , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 \n Trent has been working out and could be close to making his return soon.  \nOwner Mark Cuban told The Dallas Morning News that Trent will be back by Dec. \n20 \"at the latest\".  This should not persuade Fantasy owners to pick him up.  \nUnless you desperately need a forward, wait and see if he remains healthy \nwhen he returns before you pick him up.    \n\n Iakovos Tsakalidis , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 \n Tsakalidis was placed on the injured list due to a dental problem.  When he \nwas drafted during the offseason Phoenix hoped that he could move into the \nstarting lineup.  He has played sparingly so far this season and has been a \nmajor Fantasy bust.  If you have him on your Fantasy team it's time for you \nto let him go.    \n\n Predrag Stojakovic , F SAC - Fear Updated 12/11/00 \n Stojakovic missed his second straight game on Sunday night with a bruised \nright shoulder. He injured the shoulder in practice on Thursday and hasn't \nplayed since. In the wake of Stojakovic's injury, Fantasy owners may want to \nlook elsewhere for a forward if your roster allows a solid replacement.    \n\n Rasheed Wallace , F POR - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00 \n Wallace has been listed as day-to-day on the NBA's injury report with a \nsprained right wrist. He sustained the injury during Friday night's loss to \nthe Sixers and missed Saturday's game against Detroit. Wallace, who is one of \nthe league's few solid Fantasy centers, has averaged 20.1 points per game to \nlead the Blazers this season. With so few options at center, some Fantasy \nowners may have to roll the dice with Wallace this week and hope he returns \nto the court for Tuesday night's game at Golden State.    \n\n Kobe Bryant , G LAL - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00 \n Bryant suffered a slight sprain on his left ankle during Sunday's game \nagainst the Pistons. The injury is not serious, and the league's leading \nscorer isn't expected to miss any time. Continue starting Bryant, who has \nbecome a real Fantasy stud, on a weekly basis.    \n\n Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/11/00 \n Hill was activated from the injured list before tonight's game against the \nLos Angeles Clippers. The former Duke star has missed all but two of \nOrlando's 20 games this season with an ankle injury. In his only two \nappearances, Hill averaged 13.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and 6.5 assists per \ngame. He may need a few games to get his feet back under him, but Hill should \nstill produce numbers good enough to warrant a start this week.     \n\n Kendall Gill , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 \n Gill missed his third consecutive game on Sunday night due to tendinitis in \nhis right knee. He isn't expected to return to the Nets' lineup until \nSaturday, when the team travels to Atlanta. Gill has been a major \ndisappointment to Fantasy owners early in the season, averaging only 10.5 \npoints per game. It may be time to cut your losses and drop Gill if another \nviable option is open to you.    \n\n Stephon Marbury , G NJ - The Old School Fools Updated 12/11/00 \n Marbury, who has missed New Jersey's last four games with a sprained ankle, \nexpects to return to the court for the Nets' Tuesday night contest against \nhis former team, the Minnesota Timberwolves. \"I'm playing Tuesday. \nAbsolutely,\" said Marbury. \"I know it's going to hurt. I've gotten to the \npoint where I feel like I'm confortable.\"  Unless you have two solid guards \nwith four-game schedules, it would be wise to get Marbury back into your \nstarting lineup this week.    \n\n Chucky Atkins , G DET - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 \n Atkins suffered a bruised heel during Sunday night's game  against the \nLakers. He shot just 2-for-10 in only 20 minutes of play. The injury isn't \nconsidered serious, and Atkins should return to practice on Tuesday. The \nPistons' point guard leads his team in assists (5.2) and is second in scoring \n(12.8), and does have some value in the world of Fantasy, especially to those \nowners in deeper leagues. With a three-game week, it may be better to sit \nAtkins if your roster allows it.    \n\n Bimbo Coles , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 \n Coles will have a bone scan on Monday and will undergo arthroscopic surgery \non his inflamed left knee on Tuesday. Coles, who was placed on the injured \nlist on Nov. 22, was supposed to be activated for Saturday night's game \nagainst Atlanta before his knee began bothering him again. The Cleveland \nreserve has very little Fantasy value, especially on a team with Andre Miller \nand Brevin Knight.    \n\n Elton Brand , F CHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/11/00 \n Brand returned to the court on Saturday night after missing three games with \na hyperextended right knee. He scored 23 points in 33 minutes of play in \nChicago's 105-81 loss to San Antonio. Fantasy owners who possess the rights \nto Brand should put him back into their starting lineup when roster changes \noccur.  \n\n Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00 \n Coleman is set to resume practice on Monday and will have private sessions \nwith a personal trainer to keep his weight down. Coleman, who has been on the \ninjured list since Nov. 18 due to a lack of physical training, had reportedly \nweighed as much as 297 pounds earlier this fall. The team is hoping to have \nhim back by the end of December. When Coleman does return, only time will \ntell if he can regain the form that lead his team in rebounding and was \nsecond in scoring a year ago. Use caution before picking up Coleman, who has \nall the talent to become a solid Fantasy player but seems to lack the drive \nand motivation to be considered a real commodity.   \n\n Roshown McLeod , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00 \n McLeod hopes to return to the Hawks' lineup on Monday after spending over a \nmonth on the injured list. McLeod, who had been granted a \"leave\" by the team \nto deal with the death of his mother, avearged 9.1 points and 2.7 rebounds in \nseven games this season.  He has very little Fantasy value.   \n\n Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/10/00 \n The 76ers placed Snow on the injured list with a stress fracture in his \nright ankle. Snow, who plays point guard next to star Allen Iverson, \nunderwent a CT scan Thursday that revealed the stress fracture. He is \nexpected to be out for six to eight weeks.   \n\n Kenny Anderson , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 \n The Celtics activated Anderson on Sunday and placed guard Chris Carr on the \ninjured list with a sprained left ankle.   Anderson had been on the injured \nlist since Nov. 6 with a fractured jaw. He had a wire removed from his jaw \nDec. 6 and was cleared to practice Dec. 7. He missed 16 games with the \ninjury.    \n\n Erick Strickland , G NY - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 \n Strickland sat out Saturday's home game against Denver due to a bruised \nleg.  He was a valuable Fantasy player as a member of the Dallas Mavericks \nlast season but is limited now by his lack of playing time with the Knicks.   \n \n\n Emanual Davis , G SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00 \n Davis missed his second straight start for the Sonics because of a sprained \nankle. Forward Ruben Patterson started in place of Davis, with Rashard Lewis \nmoving to shooting guard.  Davis is a solid ballhandler and defender but \ndoesn't have much Fantasy value.    \n\n Elliot Perry , G PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 \n The Suns have signed veteran guard Elliot Perry.  He will be used primarily \nas Jason Kidd's backup but has limited Fantasy value.  \n\n Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 \n Dudley was activated from the injured list and started in Thursday's game at \nMilwaukee.  With the lack of depth at center, Dudley could be of good use in \na larger Fantasy league, but don't use him in a smaller one.    \n\n Ruben Garces , F PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 \n Garces was placed on the injured list to make room for C Chris Dudley.  \nGarces is suffering from a bulging disc in his back.  He is used primarily as \na third center so he doesn't have a lot of Fantasy value.  \n\n Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 \n Marshall had missed the two games prior to Thursday's action because of a \nsprained knee, but returned to the lineup against Vancouver and had seven \npoints and three rebounds in 14 minutes.  Because Marshall comes off the \nbench he doesn't have much Fantasy value.  But with him back in the rotation \nforwards Karl Malone and Bryon Russell will play less minutes now.     \n\n Carlos Rogers , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 \n Rogers will be sidelined indefinitely after suffering a sprained knee.  He \nis a reserve forward with very little Fantasy value but his absence will \nforce the starting frontcourt to play more minutes.  This could have positive \nor negative affects on their production.  If you have Houston frontcourt \nplayers on your roster monitor them to see if they flourish or flounder under \nthe current conditions.    \n\n Donnell Harvey , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 \n Harvey has been activated from the injured list to make room for the injured \nGreg Buckner.  Harvey is a solid rebounder but won't receive enough playing \ntime to be a valuable Fantasy player.     \n\n Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 \n Buckner will undergo surgery early next week to remove a cracked bone spur \non his right foot.  The surgery could sideline Buckner for 6-8 weeks.  Rookie \nDonnell Harvey was activated form the injured list to make room for \nBuckner.   This is the second time this season that he has been sidelined \nwith the same injury.  Fantasy owners should avoid Buckner for he rest of the \nseason or until he is playing and producing on a consistent basis again.     \n\n Charles Oakley , F TOR - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00 \n Oakley has served his league-imposed suspension and is eligible to return to \nthe Raptors' lineup for Friday night's game at Golden State.  \"Oak,\" who was \nsuspended for punching Clippers' point guard Jeff McInnis, has Fantasy value \nas a rebounder only, and isn't considered a real commodity outside of deeper \nleagues.    \n\n Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/08/00 \n Although the team is calling him a game-time decision, it looks as though \nCarter will return to the court on Friday night against the Golden State \nWarriors.  Carter practiced with the team on Thursday, and is exciting about \nthe prospect of playing against his former Tar Heel teammate,  Antawn \nJamison. All signs point towards Carter's return by this weekend at the very \nlatest, so add a little \"Vinsanity\" to your starting lineup next week.    \n\n Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/08/00 \n Hill was a game time scratch on Thursday night against the Nuggets. The \nOrlando Sentinel is reporting that Hill is expected to return to the court on \nMonday when the Magic travel to Los Angeles for a date with the Clippers. \nHill's return is long overdue for Fantasy owners who held onto his rights \nthis season. Unless you have a number of solid forwards on your roster, give \nHill the start this week pending any setbacks.    \n\n Hidayet Turkoglu , G SAC - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00 \n Turkoglu is suffering from a shoulder injury and is questionable for \nFriday's game against Houston.  He is a key reserve on the Kings' team but \nhas very little Fantasy value.     \n\nMore Updates \n\nCopyright 2000 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.\nYour site is always at http://basketball.commissioner.com/efba\n\nBK10SP", "meta": {}, "labels": [[10, 291, "paragraph"], [293, 334, "paragraph"], [336, 517, "paragraph"], [519, 669, "paragraph"], [671, 846, "paragraph"], [850, 892, "paragraph"], [894, 934, "paragraph"], [1108, 1161, "paragraph"], [1185, 1228, "paragraph"], [1263, 1316, "paragraph"], [1416, 1469, "paragraph"], [1582, 1618, "paragraph"], [1621, 1675, "paragraph"], [1677, 1735, "quotation_marker"], [1736, 2147, "paragraph"], [2149, 2201, "quotation_marker"], [2275, 2513, "paragraph"], [2515, 2565, "quotation_marker"], [2566, 2918, "paragraph"], [2920, 2978, "quotation_marker"], [2979, 3305, "paragraph"], [3307, 3359, "quotation_marker"], [3360, 3665, "paragraph"], [3667, 3730, "quotation_marker"], [3731, 4249, "paragraph"], [4251, 4310, "quotation_marker"], [4311, 4583, "paragraph"], [4585, 4633, "quotation_marker"], [4634, 5072, "paragraph"], [5074, 5125, "quotation_marker"], [5126, 5527, "paragraph"], [5529, 5593, "quotation_marker"], [5594, 6072, "paragraph"], [6074, 6127, "quotation_marker"], [6128, 6620, "paragraph"], [6622, 7076, "paragraph"], [7078, 7134, "quotation_marker"], [7135, 7450, "paragraph"], [7452, 7509, "quotation_marker"], [7510, 8177, "paragraph"], [8179, 8233, "quotation_marker"], [8234, 8532, "paragraph"], [8534, 8588, "quotation_marker"], [8589, 8849, "paragraph"], [8851, 8905, "quotation_marker"], [8906, 9220, "paragraph"], [9222, 9277, "quotation_marker"], [9278, 9506, "paragraph"], [9564, 9830, "paragraph"], [9832, 9884, "quotation_marker"], [9885, 10018, "paragraph"], [10020, 10072, "quotation_marker"], [10152, 10294, "paragraph"], [10296, 10348, "quotation_marker"], [10349, 10561, "paragraph"], [10563, 10619, "quotation_marker"], [10620, 10994, "paragraph"], [10996, 11049, "quotation_marker"], [11050, 11460, "paragraph"], [11462, 11516, "quotation_marker"], [11596, 11715, "paragraph"], [11717, 11769, "quotation_marker"], [11770, 12226, "paragraph"], [12228, 12282, "quotation_marker"], [12283, 12608, "paragraph"], [12610, 12667, "quotation_marker"], [12668, 13119, "paragraph"], [13121, 13169, "quotation_marker"], [13170, 13601, "paragraph"], [13603, 13842, "paragraph"], [13859, 13981, "personal_signature"], [935, 1106, "paragraph"], [1162, 1184, "paragraph"], [1229, 1261, "paragraph"], [1317, 1415, "paragraph"], [1508, 1580, "paragraph"], [2202, 2273, "paragraph"], [9510, 9563, "quotation_marker"], [10073, 10151, "paragraph"], [11517, 11595, "paragraph"], [13983, 13989, "personal_signature"], [13844, 13856, "paragraph"], [0, 7, "technical"], [1492, 1505, "section_heading"], [1484, 1491, "technical"]]}
