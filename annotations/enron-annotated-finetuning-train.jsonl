The intranet site will be placed on the \nhome.enron.com webpage by Tuesday morning for all Enron employees to access. \nHowever, today, this comprehensive database is available to you for your \nCalifornia Power Issue needs. \n\nThe database has been populated with the latest information that I have \nreceived concerning this topic and has been broken down in three categories:\nCalifornia Power Issues, National Power Issues and Secured Documents. It has \nthen been broken down further into subcategories.\n\nThe secured documents sections will only be accessible to those that are \nreceiving this e-mail. Please let me know if you believe others should have \naccess to this information. The secured document section contains all the \ninformation that I have received that Luntz Consulting has helped us develop, \ni.e. principals, statements, speeches and facts, as well as, talking points \nand other statements developed internally. These documents can be easily \nswitched to open access to all Enron employees if you believe that these \ndocuments should not be restricted.\n\nTo access the intranet site you must be logged on to the network and then go \nto this link:  http://nahou-lndev02d.corp.enron.com/GovtAffa.nsf  (It is best \nif you copy this link and paste it in your internet Explorer or Netscape \nbrowser.)\n\nOnce you are at this site you will  be able to access all articles and \ninformation that I have collected/received concerning the California Power \nIssue. You can navigate the site by using the links on the left hand side of \nthe screen. While navigating this site, keep in mind that the actual \ninterface will be changed before we go live on Tuesday morning. \n\nTo access the secured documents, click on secured documents and type in your \nuser name, which is the same as if you are logging onto the network, and then \ntype in your password, which is the same as if you are logging onto the \nnetwork. However, if you have difficulties entering this site, you will need \nto change your Lotus internet password. Which is very simple to do and which \nyou will need to do regardless if you decide to use this site or not, it is \nall part of the current computer migration. To change your internet password, \ngo to this link  and then hit the edit person key. Go to the last field that \nsays internet password and type in whatever password you would like, \npreferably your current network login password. (In the internet password \nsection you will see a bunch of numbers and letters, delete those and enter \nyour new network password.) \n\nThere are still some bugs that will be worked out by Tuesday, but I thought \nsince this is such a fast moving issue it was best to get this tool out so it \ncould be used when needed.

(Dutch, English, first price-sealed bid, \nand second-price sealed bid.) In fact, the selling price is equal to the \nvaluation of the second highest bidder. For example, in Vickrey auction, \neveryone bids at his own valuation. Hence, the winner pays the valuation of \nthe second highest bidder. In English auction, the second highest valuation \nbidder will stop competing if the price is above his valuation. Hence, the \nwinner also gets the item at the price of the second highest valuation bidder.\nThank you for attending the meeting and giving many helpful contributions.\n-chonawee", "meta": {}, "labels": [[0, 9, "salutation"], [11, 300, "paragraph"], [302, 508, "paragraph"], [510, 555, "paragraph"], [557, 562, "closing"], [594, 613, "quotation_marker"], [614, 652, "inline_headers"], [670, 1429, "paragraph"], [1430, 1439, "closing"], [653, 668, "inline_headers"], [569, 593, "quotation_marker"]]}

The program gives prospective parents an \nopportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of \nadopting an older  child.\n \nIn 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - \n96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 \npercent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through \nthe program.

I need your \nhelp to make sure I have \"Gore-like\" command of the details.  Please help \nwith the following information:\nEnron project information (Parquet/McCubbin) -- please give me any \npresentations or summaries you have on the generation, or firm purchases, we \nhave under way (or planned).  I'll talk with you to find out what we are \ncomfortable disclosing but please err on the side of giving whatever \ninformation you have.\nUpdated Belden presentation (Hain/Belden) -- I believe the latest information \nwas as of August; I think some of the information on the cost of peaking \nfacilities is particularly eye-opening on the price cap issue.\nComparison to PJM (Hartsoe/Novosel) -- Is the information we are seeking from \nthe ISO and PX similar to information PJM already provides?  If so, it would \nbe nice to tie our requests back to something the Commission has already \napproved.\nCancelled DSM projects (Mahoney) -- Again, I'll only use what we feel \ncomfortable with, but it would help make our point if we can give examples of \nhow price caps backfire when it comes to encouraging conservation.\nISO/PX reports (Dasovich).  I have the ISO market surveillance report.  Is \nthere another ISO report?  If so, please get me a copy and provide a copy of \nthe PX report too.\nCEC/Proposed generation update (Mara/Parquet) -- Need the basic information: \nproposed, waiting for permitting; how much/little the legislation did to \nexpedite siting (ie are we still comfortable saying that it applies to less \nthan 10%)?\nSoft cap(Belden/Hain) -- need a crisp explanation of why the \"soft\" nature of \nthe cap is not sufficient.  Also, would we be OK if the Commission revised it \nto say that bids can be taken above 150 without special filing or reporting \nrequirements, but those bids will be accepted at the price bid rather than \napplying to all lower bids as well (ie the highest bid at or below 150 clears \nthe market, bids above 150 accepted at price bid as needed)?\nOffers we have made/deals done (Parquet/Dasovich/ Mccubbin) -- Roseville plus \nany others, offer made to SDG&E -- I want to make the point that the market \nwill provide solutions (below the retail price cap) if we get the utility \n(and the regulators) out of the merchant function.\nHerding the cats(Hartsoe/mccubbin/mara/dasovich):  We are asking FERC to be \ncourageous, do the right thing and ignore the politics.  To be even halfway \ncredible, we can't have IEP, EPSA, Dynegy or anyone else \"squishing\" on the \nprice cap issue..  We have never been closer to reform in California, we need \nthese guys on board.\nThanks.", "meta": {}, "labels": [[0, 12, "salutation"], [14, 392, "paragraph"], [394, 405, "closing"], [422, 441, "quotation_marker"], [442, 536, "inline_headers"], [920, 1361, "paragraph"], [1364, 1542, "inline_headers"], [1765, 1780, "inline_headers"], [1782, 3202, "paragraph"], [3281, 4506, "paragraph"], [4507, 4514, "closing"], [3203, 3279, "paragraph"], [1543, 1764, "inline_headers"], [537, 874, "inline_headers"], [412, 421, "quotation_marker"], [877, 916, "inline_headers"]]}

To increase our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid Stentofon address numbers.  Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 and 900 series numbers for the addresses.  In order to add more addresses to the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system.  This conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th.\n\nIn efforts to minimize the number of times each user will change their number, we will be converting all Stentofon addresses in EB1 that are scheduled to move into ESC this year to a 5000 series number.    (i.e.  If your Stento number was 364, then your new number will be 5364.)  We will also change all speed dials to reflect the new dialing scheme.  Please instruct the users within your group of this change.\n\nAll Enron Broadband Stentofons will have their numbers changed to a 4000 series number.  (i.e.  If your Stento number was 576, then your new number will be 4576.)  \n\nIn summary, all Stentofon numbers will be changing this weekend.  If you are scheduled to move into ECS, then your Stento number will begin with a '5' and if you are to remain at EB1, then your Stento number will begin with a '4'.\n\nPlease inform all users of the Stentofon System of this change and pass this information to anyone that needs it.\n\n\nThank you for your understanding and cooperation.\n\nRegards, \nDarren Adamik\nMgr.-Trading Technology \nEnron Net Works, LLC \n713.853.4764 Office\n713-853-9828 Fax\nmailto:darren.p.adamik@enron.com", "meta": {}, "labels": [[0, 26, "quotation_marker"], [27, 944, "inline_headers"], [1035, 1630, "paragraph"], [1632, 2044, "paragraph"], [2046, 2210, "paragraph"], [2212, 2442, "paragraph"], [2444, 2557, "paragraph"], [2560, 2609, "paragraph"], [2611, 2620, "closing"], [2621, 2751, "personal_signature"], [945, 961, "inline_headers"], [963, 1032, "section_heading"]]}
